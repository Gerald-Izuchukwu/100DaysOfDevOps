the script from Day03 has been updated

here after running with Start, the script copies the contents from app.js, a file already in the directory to the server.js file. 

I wish there was an api i could call to fetch a simple https server code

Every other thing remains the same.

Also I updated the Stop phase both here and in Day03 because, the command from Day03 also deleted the README file

The build commad has not been worked on, hopefully before Day10
