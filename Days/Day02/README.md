For today day 2, after gaining a little knowledge about shell scripting and build tools, I tried to build a shell script that runs a node server.

It initializes npm repository, create a server that listens on a port.

The script checks to see if the server file already exists, and then proceeds tpo create the file if it doesnt 

to run the program:

1. clone the Repository 

2. Change into Day02 directory:

cd Days/Day02

3. run the shell script:

to do this: ./setup.sh

4. install dependencies:

to do this: npm install express

5. run node server.js file

to do this: node server.js
